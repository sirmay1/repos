    <h2 class="child spaghetti-ingriedients-listed">The seven things you'll need for your spaghetti recipe</h2>
    <h3 class="child stepOne">Step One: Gather your things before you cook</h3>
    <ul class="container-ul ingredient-list">
        <li class="liChild numOne"> a box of spaghetti</li>
        <li class="liChild numTwo"> a jar of marinara sauce</li>
        <li class="liChild numThree"> 1-2 pounds of ground beerf or Italian sausage</li>
        <li class="liChild numFour"> two large pots, one for boiling the pasta and the other for making the sauce</li>
        <li class="liChild numFive"> serving untensils</li>
        <li class="liChild numSix"> salt</li>
        <li class="liChild numSeven"> finally, water</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="side-note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can use as much meat as you want, really, but anywhere from 1-2 pounds per large jar sauce should work out best. I tend to use 1 pound of meat anytime I make this.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="stepTwo">Step Two: Boiling the water and cooking the meat</h3>
    <ol class="spaghetti-order">
        <li class="stepOne">fill a large pot with water and add salt. Now place it over the flames till it boils.</li>
        <li class="stepOne">Next, cook the meat. Make sure the meat is completely pulled out from the container and set it all in the large pan. Then put the pan on the stove and set the stove to medium.</li>
        <li class="stepOne">While the meat is cooking break up the meat into smaller pieces so it cooks evenly.</li>
        <li class="stepOne">Give it a few minutes and when the meat has been siting for a couple of minutes start flipping the meat and make sure it gets brown all around and cooked thoroughly. This processes should take you no longer than 15 minutes.</li>
        <li class="stepOne">When all the meat is brown and nicely cooked you can add the sause.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3 class="stepThree">Step Three: Mixing the sauce</h3>
    <ul class="mix-the-sauce">
        <li class="step1">Get ready to prepare the marinara sauce and keep on sturring</li>
        <li class="step2">Once your marinara sauce is ready get ready to mix the sauce with the meat</li>
        <li class="step3">Take the marinara sauce and pour it all over your cooked meat</li>
        <li class="step4">Now stir the meat and the sauce together till it is nicely blended</li>
        <li class="step5">after your finished sturring the contents. Lower the flames so it slowly cookes, you don't want to burn dry out the sauce or burn the meat</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3 class="step-four">Step Four: Getting ready to serve the spaghetti</h3>
    <p class="spaghetti-options-to-serve">To serve spaghetti you have different options. Me personally I prefer to serve my spaghetti plain on a dish and then pour the sauce on the side of the spaghetti.</p>
    <ul class="spaghettiFinalStep">
        <li class="lastOne">grab a drainer to drain the water from the spaghetti</li>
        <li class="lastTwo">use a tong to serve your hot spaghetti onto your plate or you can choose to serve the spaghetti and mix it in the pot with your sauce</li>
        <li class="lastThree">This is optional but I tend to enjoy this part. I would shake marinara cheese and grade it all over the spaghetti to give it a final flavor</li>
        <li class="lastFour">the spaghetti is hot and it served with flavor, enjoy eating!</li>
    </ul>
