May 13th, 2022 THE ODIN PROJECT ASSIGNMENT ON HTML

THE ODIN PROJECT- CH. HTML... Iteration 1: Initial Structure


Within the odin-recipes directory, create an index.html file.
Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.
Iteration 2: Recipe Page
Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example lasagna.html. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration, you can find a recipe to use here.
For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
Back in the index.html file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.
Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
The recipe page should have the following content:

An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or the recipe site we linked to earlier.
Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.
Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.

PERSONAL-NOTE: remember! Do what your told. If the assiment reads HTML, do only HTML. Don't include CSS or JavaScript.  This is a focused study, not a creative session.


    Peronsal Note:

    Since I had been familiar with HTML from December of 2021. Till now May of 2022. I found coming into the Odin Project and learning HTML to be very easy, infact I would go so far as to say a warm up. I know I will breeze by the course until I reach the JavaScript portion. I would like to also include that I have a feeling that the CSS portion shouldn't be so difficult. But once I hit flexbox and Grid I am pretty sure there will be things within this chapter that will help me to improve in those skills. Because I know the basics of flexbox and grid. But my problem still exist when it comes to creating the over all layout of a webpage like a laying page. I find it still very difficult to line up the boxes of the content correctly within the window of the page. Hopefully with practice over time I will improve.
    
    But in conclusion, I don't have much to say in reference to the HTML portion. It was quite simple and very easy to create the boiler plate and to structure the layout of the over all page. I have a good grasp on how to create links, script files and to include things like the article tags or the form tag for the input. I had seen some abuse the div tag and that is all they know how to use. Div's do serve a purpose but shouldn't be labeled all over your entire HTML page only.
